# Scrum

## Definition

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

- A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.

- The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.

- The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.

- Repeat


## Scrum Theory

- Transparency: All the work and the progress must be visible for all Scrum team members.
- Inspection: The progress mus be inspected frequently.
- Adaptation: If the resulting product its unacceptable, the process being applied or the materiasl being produced must be adjusted.

## Scrum Values

**Commitment, Focus, Oppennes, Respect, and Courage**

The Scrum Team **commits** to achieving its goals and to supporting each other. 
Their primary focus is on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress toward these goals. 
The Scrum Team and its stakeholders are **open** about the work and the challenges. 
Scrum Team members **respect** each other to be capable, independent people, and are respected as such by the people with whom they work. 
The Scrum Team members have the **courage** to do the right thing, to work on tough problems.

## Scrum Team

The fundamental unit of Scrum isa a small team of people. 
- One Scrum Master
- One Product Owner
- And the developers 

## Scrum Eventes

### Sprints

They are fixed length events of one month or less where ideas are turned into value. 
A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.

During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

### Daily Scrums

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.
The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. 

### Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
